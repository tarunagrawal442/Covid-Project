# Covid-Project
This repository contains code, and visualisations created using R, and Tableau for Covid data till date. It directly fetches data from "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" which is up to date, and uses R to filter the data accordingly. 
The R is used to tidy and clean data, which is then visualised using Tableau.
